# CSCI230
My Data Structures and Algorithms Projects

So far only Assignment 2: Sorting Algorithms has been added as they are the only ones with .java files
SelectionSort.java
InsertionSort.java
TestSorting.java

#DIRECTIONS
1. For each sorting algorithm, submit TWO files (DO NOT ZIP): 
 a. your java source code as InsertionSort.java / QuickSort.java
 b. a screen snapshot showing the output, as in the samples. 

2. Use proper documentation (the comments) to your source code.
